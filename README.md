## AutoHotkey XBox (360) controller script
I use a xbox 360 controller on my pc and i use an autohotkey script to activate or close the active window based on a few button presses. It's handy to quit or activate a game (window)... You can grab it [here](https://gist.github.com/joyrider3774/23facbe6664001486a4fc35af868a78c) but you will need to compile it with [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
